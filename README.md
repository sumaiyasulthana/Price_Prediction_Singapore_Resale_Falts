 **Singapore  Resale Flat Prices Predicting:** The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application that predicts the resale prices of flats in Singapore. This predictive model will be based on historical data of resale flat transactions, and it aims to assist both potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.

TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED : The process involves:

Data Extraction: Collect a dataset of resale flat transactions from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) for the years 1990 to Till Date.

Data Transformation: Using Python and Pandas to clean and structure the data.Preprocess the data to clean and structure it for machine learning.

Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the dataset, including town, flat type, storey range_start & end, floor area, flat model, and lease commence date,year and mont 
                     Created any additional features that may enhance prediction accuracy.
Model Selection and Training: Choose an appropriate machine learning model for regression (e.g., linear regression, decision trees,random forests,xgboost,gradient Boosting,Adaboost,
). 
Train the model on the historical data, using a portion of the dataset for training.


Dashboard Creation: Using Streamlit and Plotly to build an interactive dashboard, In an advance way to get animation effects

Data Retrieval: Fetching data directly from the database of SQLITE to dynamically update the dashboard.

REQUIRED LIBRARIES:

plotly.express
2.streamlit

3.sqlalchemy

4.sqlite3

5.pandas

6.PIL

7.matplotlib.pyplot

FEATURES of my App: The following functions are available in my Pluse Project. Retrieval of data Year wise,Quarter wise,State and District wise.Even more pincode wise Registered users details with on which brand of Mobile Transaction is been done.

Collecting of data and store temporary in pandas dataframe.

Migration of data from the dataframe to a SQLITE database directly for efficient querying and analysis.

Search and retrieval of data from the SQLITE database using different search options
